        <h1>Privacy Policy for NeonFlips</h1>
        <p class="date">Last updated: February 28, 2026</p>

        <p>Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at NeonFlips. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy notice, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us.</p>

        <p>When you use our mobile application, as the case may be (the "App") and more generally, use any of our services (the "Services", which include the App), we appreciate that you are trusting us with your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy notice, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it and what rights you have in relation to it.</p>

        <h2>1. What information do we collect?</h2>
        
        <h3>Personal information you disclose to us</h3>
        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not collect any personal information unless you voluntarily provide it to us.</p>
        <p>Currently, NeonFlips operates primarily offline. We do not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or share any personal identifying information to play the core game.</p>
        
        <p>However, if you choose to participate in our Leaderboard feature, you may be asked to provide a username. This username is stored solely for the purpose of displaying your score on the public leaderboard. <strong>We do not collect emails, passwords, or other sensitive personal data.</strong></p>

        <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>
        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our App.</p>
        <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the App. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our App and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
        
        <p>Like many businesses, we also collect information through Firebase Analytics or similar standard crash reporting and analytics tools to understand how users interact with our App and to improve its functionality.</p>

        <h2>2. How do we use your information?</h2>
        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We process your information for purposes based on legitimate business interests, the fulfillment of our contract with you, compliance with our legal obligations, and/or your consent.</p>
        <p>We use the information we collect or receive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate account creation and logon process (if applicable for Leaderboards).</li>
            <li>To maintain your high scores and game settings locally on your device (using DataStore).</li>
            <li>To improve our App's functionality and user experience based on crash reports.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Will your information be shared with anyone?</h2>
        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</p>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with third parties for their promotional purposes. We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include: data analysis, email delivery, hosting services (e.g., Firebase for leaderboards/analytics), customer service and marketing efforts.</p>

        <h2>4. How long do we keep your information?</h2>
        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information.</p>

        <h2>5. How do we keep your information safe?</h2>
        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>6. Do we collect information from minors?</h2>
        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 13 years of age.</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 13 years of age. By using the App, you represent that you are at least 13 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the App.</p>

        <h2>7. Updates to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions or comments about this notice, you may contact the developer of NeonFlips directly.</p>
